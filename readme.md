# DMZ-Missions (Temp Name)

- Do you struggle to find what missions you and your friends have both unlocked, and have not completed yet?
- Do you spend 10-20 minutes at the beginning of every session figuring out what "to do" with your friends?
- This website/application is intended to help fix that issue.

Welcome to DMZ-Missions.  This website/application is designed to help you keep track of your progress in the DMZ mode inside of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.
- Keep track of which missions you've completed.
- Compare with friends or potential friends what missions you have unlocked and which missions you've completed.  The application will display all missions that you all have unlocked and have NOT completed.  Giving you a list of things you could do together!
- This app will also give you the ability to see where your friends are in their mission progress.  Giving you a quick view of what missions they need to complete to 'catch up' to your mission progress.

More to come in this readme soon.

- CSS Grid repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr)) <-- This was very important and I need to potentially use this in my mission and FOB grids.  I can also use auto-fit where applicable.  Took me a while to figure this out and it's so much better than using @media queries.
