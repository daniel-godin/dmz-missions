          This website is designed to help you keep track of your progress in Call of Duty, as well as help you coordinate with friends or strangers to do missions or challenges together.  I build this website because I was tired of always asking, "What missions do you have?  What missions are you on?  What are you trying to collect?", and more.  This website is designed to help alleviate that problem.
